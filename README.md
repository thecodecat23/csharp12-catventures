Welcome to CSharp12Catventures, where we explore the exciting new features of C# 12, one paw-step at a time!

Each project in this repository showcases a different C# 12 feature, making it easy for you to learn and experiment with each one. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a coding kitten just starting out, there's something here for you!

## Projects :computer:

1. **CatCafe** - This project showcases the use of primary constructors, a proposed feature in C# 12. It's a simple console application that simulates a cat caf√©, with different types of cats represented by different classes. Each cat has its own properties and behaviors, defined using primary constructors.

Stay tuned for more projects as we continue our journey through C# 12!
